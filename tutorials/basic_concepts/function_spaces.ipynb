Currently, only `order == 1` is supported.\n",

These spaces form a stable dual pairing together with continuous, piecewise linear functions and are needed for certain opposite order preconditioners.\n",

In this example, the element has three local basis functions (associated with the three vertices of the element), and the values of `global_dofs` are the indices of the global basis functions that they map to. The array `weights` returns scalar multipliers that are the weights with which the local basis function contributes to the global basis function. Hence, to obtain the local coefficient of a local basis function the corresponding global dof coefficient needs to be multiplied with the `weight`. For most basis types the weight is always 1. But for example, for Raviart-Thomas basis functions it can differ. Weights are only returned if the parameter `dof_weights=True` is set."
